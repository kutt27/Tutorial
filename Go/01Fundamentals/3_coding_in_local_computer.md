### go.mod file

If you are coding in your local machine with neccessary modules, we need to create a file called "go.mod" or it will give an error when coding in the file. To create it, simply create the go.mod file we have to run the following command.

```go
go mod init <project_name>
```

Another way is to move your project into the GOPATH directory.
