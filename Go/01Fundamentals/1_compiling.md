### Compiling

To *compile* a go program we need to first run the command in the terminal

```go
go build main.go
```

Above code will compile the code and creates a executable file, we can checkout the executable file with the following command in the terminal.

```
ls

main    main.go
```

Then we could just compile the file with the given command:

```
./greet
```
