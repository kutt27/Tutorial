For processing and storing text we can use string. Syntax with be the following:

_var <string-name> string_

For example:
```go
var movie string = "Titanic 1997"
```

---
*Important*

If we don't assign a value to the variable. Automatically it's assigned to zero.

For example

```go
var emptyInt number
fmt.Println(emptyInt)
```
