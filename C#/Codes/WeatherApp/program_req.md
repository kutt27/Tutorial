### Retrieve Weather Data from API

- Choose a weather API to fetch the weather data. OpenWeatherMap is a popular choice.
- Sign up for a free API key from OpenWeatherMap.
- In your C# code, create an HttpClient object to send HTTP requests to the API endpoint.
-Use the API key and the desired location to construct the API request URL.
- Send a GET request to the API and retrieve the weather data as a JSON response.
- Deserialize the JSON response to obtain the weather details.

### Display Weather Information

- Parse the weather data received from the API and extract the relevant information, such as temperature, humidity, weather description, etc.
- Design a user-friendly console interface to display the weather information to the user.

### Handle Errors

- Implement error handling to account for scenarios where the API request fails or the response is invalid.
- Handle exceptions gracefully and display appropriate error messages to the user.

### Testing and Refinement

- Test your weather app with various locations and verify that it provides accurate weather information.
- Refine your code, improve error handling, and add any additional features you desire.
